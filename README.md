CogniDoc ü§ñüìÑ
Leveraging LLMs to provide a conversational interface for intelligent document querying and summarization.

CogniDoc transforms the way you interact with your documents. Instead of manually searching through pages of text, you can simply ask questions in plain English and get instant, accurate answers. Whether you're a student researching a paper, a professional analyzing reports, or anyone trying to extract key information, CogniDoc is your intelligent document assistant.

## Key Features ‚ú®
Conversational Q&A: Ask questions about your documents in a natural, conversational way.

Intelligent Summarization: Get concise summaries of entire documents or specific sections instantly.

Multi-File Support: Upload and query multiple documents at once (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT).

Source Citing: Never lose track of information. Every answer is backed by references to the exact source text in the original document.

Secure & Private: Your documents are processed locally, ensuring your data remains confidential.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
CogniDoc uses a powerful technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The process is simple yet effective:

Document Ingestion: When you upload a document, it's parsed, broken down into manageable chunks, and converted into numerical representations called embeddings.

Vector Storage: These embeddings are stored in a specialized vector database, which allows for ultra-fast semantic searching.

Querying: When you ask a question, your query is also converted into an embedding.

Retrieval: The system searches the vector database to find the document chunks that are most semantically similar to your question.

Generation: The retrieved chunks (the relevant context) and your original question are passed to a Large Language Model (LLM), which generates a coherent and accurate answer.

### Tech Stack
